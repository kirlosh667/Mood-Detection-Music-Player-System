# Mood-Detection-Music-Player-System
Emotion-Based Music Player is a Python application that captures a user’s facial image through a webcam, detects their emotional state using DeepFace (deep learning), and plays music that matches the detected mood. It uses OpenCV for image capture and Pygame for audio playback, creating an intelligent, interactive music experience.
